# TESmartSwitchAPI-macOS
A macOS utility for controlling a 16-port TESmart KVM switch.

This is a utility for controlling TESmart 16-port KVM switches.  It has been tested with a model HKS1601A1U switch, but should also work with the HKS1601A10, as the utilities and documentation for both appear to be identical.

Current shortcomings in this application are the networking, which is currently synchronous rather than asynchronous.  Other than that, it should be usable.
